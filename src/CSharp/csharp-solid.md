# Solid Prinicipal

## `S` is for Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- A component should do one thing and do it well, this improves readability and avoids components that are too large and hard to manage.

## O is for Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- A component should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## L is for Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- Derived classes or components should be replaceable with their base class without altering the behavior of the application

## I is for Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- A component should not be forced to depend on props it does not use.
- Split large prop interfaces into smaller ones.

## D is for Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- Components should depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
