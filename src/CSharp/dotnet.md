# Common uses of .NET Core
>
> .NET Core is a popular open-source cross-platform framework developed by Microsoft for building modern applications. Here are some of the common uses of .NET Core:

- **Web Development**: .NET Core is widely used for building web applications, including web APIs, web services, and web applications. With its modular architecture, it allows developers to create scalable and high-performance web applications.

- **Desktop Application Development**: .NET Core can be used for building desktop applications, such as Windows Forms and WPF applications. It provides a rich set of libraries and tools that simplify desktop application development.

- **Mobile App Development**: .NET Core can be used for building mobile apps using Xamarin, a cross-platform mobile app development framework. Xamarin allows developers to build native iOS and Android apps using C# and .NET Core.

- **Cloud Native Development**: .NET Core is widely used for building cloud-native applications that can run on popular cloud platforms such as Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. It provides tools and libraries for building microservices, containers, and serverless applications.

- **Gaming Development**: .NET Core can also be used for building games using Unity, a popular game engine. Unity supports C# and .NET Core, making it a popular choice for game development.

- **Machine Learning**: .NET Core can be used for building machine learning applications using ML.NET, a machine learning framework for .NET. ML.NET provides a set of libraries and tools for building custom machine learning models using C# and .NET Core.

> With its modular architecture and cross-platform capabilities, it is a versatile framework that can be used for a wide range of applications.

## Modular Architecture

    Modular architecture, also known as modular design, is an architectural style that emphasizes the separation of 
    a system into independent, self-contained modules or components. In a modular architecture, each module is 
    designed to perform a specific function or task, and can be combined with other modules to create a larger system.

    The main goal of modular architecture is to improve system maintainability, scalability, and flexibility by 
    breaking down a complex system into smaller, more manageable parts. Each module can be developed and tested 
    independently, and can be replaced or updated without affecting the rest of the system.

    In a modular architecture, the modules communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces, which specify 
    how data and information are exchanged between the modules. This helps to reduce coupling between modules, and 
    allows for easier integration and testing.

## Characteristics of .NET Core
>
> .NET Core is a popular open-source cross-platform framework developed by Microsoft for building modern applications. Here are some of the important characteristics of .NET Core:

    1. Cross-Platform: .NET Core is designed to work on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
                       This makes it easier to build and deploy applications across different environments.

    2. Open-Source: .NET Core is open-source and free to use, which means developers can access the source code, 
                    contribute to the project, and customize the framework to meet their specific needs.

    3. Modular: .NET Core has a modular architecture, which means that it is composed of smaller, independent 
                 components that can be used separately or combined to create larger applications. 
                 This makes it easier to develop and maintain complex applications.

    4. High Performance: .NET Core is designed for high performance, with features such as just-in-time (JIT) 
            compilation and efficient memory management. It also includes support for asynchronous programming, 
            which allows developers to build highly responsive and scalable applications.

    5. Security: .NET Core includes built-in security features, such as data encryption, authentication, 
                 and authorization, to help protect applications and data from attacks.

    6. Developer Productivity: .NET Core includes a rich set of libraries and tools that simplify application 
           development, including Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and the .NET Core CLI. 
           It also supports multiple programming languages, including C#, F#, and Visual Basic.

> Overall, these characteristics make .NET Core a popular choice for building modern, high-performance applications that can run on different platforms and devices.

## What is ASP.NET Core

    1. ASP.NET Core is a popular open-source web framework developed by Microsoft for building modern web applications.
    2. It released in 2016, is a redesign of ASP.NET also it is modular and leaner then ASP.NET.
    3. It is a cross-platform, high-performance framework that is designed to work on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    4. ASP stands for Active Server Pages, used for building web pages.
    5. ASP.NET Core works with both the .NET framework and the .NET Core framework.
    6. It merges ASP.NET Model-View-Controller (MVC), ASP.NET Web Pages, and ASP.NET API in one application framework.

> ASP.NET Core provides a wide range of features and tools for building web applications, including:

    1. MVC Framework: ASP.NET Core includes a powerful Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework, 
                     which provides a flexible and scalable approach to building web applications.

    2. Middleware: ASP.NET Core uses middleware components to handle HTTP requests and responses. 
                  Middleware components can be added or removed as needed, which allows developers 
                  to customize the behavior of the application.

    3. Dependency Injection: ASP.NET Core includes a built-in dependency injection container, 
                which simplifies the management of dependencies and makes it easier to write testable code.

    4. Tag Helpers: ASP.NET Core includes tag helpers, which are a type of server-side control that 
          can be used to generate HTML elements. Tag helpers simplify the creation of dynamic HTML content 
          and improve the readability of the code.

    5. Razor Views: ASP.NET Core includes Razor views, which are a type of template that allows 
                developers to create HTML views using C# code.

    6. Web API: ASP.NET Core provides a built-in framework for building RESTful Web APIs,
           which allows developers to create web services that can be consumed by other applications.

    7. Authentication and Authorization: ASP.NET Core includes built-in support for authentication and 
          authorization, which allows developers to secure their web applications and control access to resources.

> Overall, ASP.NET Core is a versatile web framework that provides developers with a wide range of features and tools for building modern web applications.
