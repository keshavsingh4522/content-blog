# AWS Lambda

- AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that enables developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales, patches, and monitors applications, allowing for cost-effective and efficient execution.

- Lambdaâ€™s architecture consists of `three main components`: the `event source`, the `Lambda function`, and the `downstream resources`.

> Event sources trigger Lambda functions, which then process the events and interact with downstream resources as needed.

- Event sources can be AWS services like S3, API Gateway, or custom applications. The Lambda function contains the code logic, runtime environment, and associated dependencies. Downstream resources include databases, storage systems, or other AWS services.

- Lambda integrates seamlessly within the broader AWS ecosystem by connecting with various services such as Amazon S3, DynamoDB, RDS, and more. This allows for easy data processing, transformation, and analysis in real-time or batch mode.
